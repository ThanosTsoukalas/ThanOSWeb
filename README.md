# ThanOS Web
ThanOS is an HTML workspace, designed to be as light as possible for your computer. But remember that things running in a browser (such as an operating system) can't access files in your actual OS and have limitations due to memory bandwidth. So, I am not going to roll out a version with file managers or AAA Games. I just made this repository for the fun of it! I hope you have fun checking it out :)

***Want to run a full version of ThanOS built directly for your computer?** Check out [this repository](https://github.com/ThanosTsoukalas/ThanOS)!

## Source Code Warning 
The sidebar component is borrowed from a tutorial. So many classes have weird names that I am trying to refactor. Please be patient!


No longer in development. Check ThanOS Desktop for the latest releases.
